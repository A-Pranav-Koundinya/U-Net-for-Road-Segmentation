# U-Net-for-Road-Segmentation
U-Net for Image Segmentation
This repository contains a U-Net based deep learning model for semantic segmentation tasks, implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras. The U-Net architecture is particularly well-suited for applications in biomedical image segmentation, road segmentation, and other pixel-wise prediction tasks.

ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
The unet5.ipynb notebook includes:

A full U-Net model built from scratch

Data preprocessing pipeline (image resizing, normalization, augmentation)

Training and validation of the segmentation model

Visualization of predictions on test images

Optional saving and loading of the trained model

ðŸ§  Model Architecture
The U-Net architecture follows a typical encoder-decoder structure:

Encoder (Contracting Path): Captures context using convolutional and max-pooling layers

Decoder (Expanding Path): Enables precise localization via transposed convolutions and skip connections

Skip Connections: Combine feature maps from encoder to decoder for better localization

ðŸ§ª How to Use
Prepare Dataset
Organize your dataset into images/ and masks/ folders or adapt the notebook to your own dataset structure.

Run Notebook
Open unet5.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode and run all cells step-by-step.

Model Training & Evaluation

Model trains on the input dataset

Outputs segmentation predictions for test images

Plots training history and IoU/dice scores

Model Saving
The model is optionally saved after training for future use or deployment.

ðŸ“Š Results
The notebook includes visualizations of:

Input images and their ground truth masks

Predicted segmentation masks

Accuracy and loss graphs

ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
Add Dice loss or IoU loss for better performance

Support for more advanced data augmentation

Integration with a custom dataset loader

Export model to ONNX or TensorFlow Lite for deployment
